title: "Fertility consequences of the Hungarian family tax allowance reform"
subtitle: ""
summary: "This paper studies the effectiveness of monetary incentives to increase fertility, by evaluating the response in fertility decisions of Hungarian households to a 2014  tax policy reform. After the reform the tax obligation on the labour income of families with three or more children declined substantially while that of one- or two-child families remained unchanged. The resulting after-tax income increase accruing from one additional birth thus rose the most for two-child households. The paper studies how effective this monetary incentive was at stimulating fertility. Using confidential household-level data, it estimates a Difference-in-Differences model, that compares the evolution of the decision to have one additional child across families that are differently affected by the policy. It finds that families did not respond to the monetary incentives in the expected manner; that is, the likelihood of second- and third births increased to the same extent."
