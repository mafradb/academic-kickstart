abstract: "Previous work finds women are in many settings less competitive than men. I examine how womenâ€™s relative dislike for competition affects their college application choices. I exploit a policy intervention in Hungary which generates exogenous variation in the competitiveness of college admissions. I use administrative data on applicants to estimate whether women responded differently than men to the higher competitive pressure after the intervention. I find that women select study programs with more competition for admission than men both before and after the intervention. After the intervention this difference narrows as women select programs with lower competitive pressure than men."
