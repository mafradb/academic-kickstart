abstract: "Previous work finds women are, in many settings, less competitive than men. I examine how womenâ€™s dislike for competition affects their college application choice by exploiting a (surprise) policy intervention in Hungary which drastically altered the competitiveness of college admissions. Using administrative data on applications, from both men and women, pre and post intervention, I find women's choices reveal a strong dislike for heightened competition. In this high-stakes setting, I find both men and women adjust by shifting their application choices towards less competitive programs.  The shift in women's choices was however more than 50% larger than that for comparable men and not driven by differences in risk preferences."
